[The Centre for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://www.aku.edu/mcpk/cbcb/Pages/home.aspx) at [Aga Khan University](https://www.aku.edu/Pages/home.aspx) promotes analysis of data generated from various omics such as 16s rRNA and shotgun metagenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and ensures that storage space and computational power is available.​
​​The journey started with the establishment of a biorepository of 2,500 pregnant women and their newborns between 2014 and 2017 as part of the Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement (AMANHI) study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This landmark project established that a high-quality biorepository can very well be created in a low-middle-income country setting with the necessary zeal and commitment.

Additional funding was received to create systems for in-house utilization of these biospecimens and generate data that is important and useful in the local and regional context. This required strengthening existing laboratory capacities and setting afresh a bioinformatics infrastructure. The bioinformatics component further consisted of hardware components and qualified personnel. Dr. Fyezah Jehan, Dr. M Imran Nisar, and their team have since acquired more than $4 million in funding.

Our external funding and support from the Office of the Dean makes it possible for us to create a workforce capable of critically analyzing and drawin​​g meaningful conclusions from the data. ​The Centre has been keeping an eye on the evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and is taking part in the genomic surveillance of other pathogens. We are collaborating with clinical diagnostics at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine to develop in-house pipelines for variant testing.
